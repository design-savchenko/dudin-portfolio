            <h2>Blackshield Capital - Investment portal</h2>
            <h4>UI/UX | Web & Mobile | Research | Graphic design</h4>
            <p class="hidden">
              The company helps to invest free capital in order to generate
              passive income for a person. Main investment instruments are
              securities, stocks, and bonds. Occasionally, real estate and
              precious metals. Mostly precious metals, futures, not in a
              physical form, but in the form of securities. As for shares and
              stakes in companies, we encourage the American market, and
              occasionally the European market, as they have much higher
              protection of property rights.

            <p class="title hidden">Problem</p>
            <p class="hidden">
              The business problem was that at the beginning of the concept, the
              company did not have the resources to properly store user data.
              Therefore, each client was handled individually, with a separate
              manager. The manager spent a lot of time providing the client with
              up-to-date data. The communication channel with the client was
              limited to personal communication. The client's problem was that
              he was unable to see the real state of his investment portfolio.
              Limited access to constant communication with a personal manager.

            <p class="title hidden">Task</p>
            <p class="hidden">
              The investment portal will solve several pain points at once. It
              will allow the user to track their investment portfolio at any
              time 24/7 and improve communication between the manager and the
              user. The portal will help managers monitor client portfolios and
              respond to various market situations in a timely manner.

        <p class="title hidden">Solution</p>
        <p class="subtitle hidden">Create new design for investment portal.</p>
        <p class="description hidden">
          I analyzed the architecture of the first version of the portal,
          compared the competitors' market, their advantages and disadvantages,
          and found useful insights. I identified the main roles of users. I
          thought about the logic and architecture, as well as usability, to
          make the process more understandable and convenient. The design of the
          new portal, taking into account the preliminary analysis, was
          developed in such a way as to improve the user experience of not only
          the client but also the manager - and to provide an advantage in the
          market of competitors. At the same time, the design was based on the
          company's main patterns and guidelines, as well as on the wishes based
          on a moderated analysis of the prototype testing and user feedback.
