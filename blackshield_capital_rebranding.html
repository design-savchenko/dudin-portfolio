            <h4>UI/UX | Web & Mobile | Research | Graphic design</h4>
            <p class="hidden">
              The company helps to invest free capital in order to generate
              passive income for a person. Main investment instruments are
              securities, stocks, and bonds. Occasionally, real estate and
              precious metals. Mostly precious metals, futures, not in a
              physical form, but in the form of securities. As for shares and
              stakes in companies, we encourage the American market, and
              occasionally the European market, as they have much higher
              protection of property rights.

            <p class="title hidden">Problem</p>
            <p class="hidden">
              The client's business faced the problem that all its media, web
              resources and additional resources did not interact with the
              business and were not useful. The website and social media did not
              work successfully and properly, there was no brand recognition in
              the market among competitors, and there was no corporate identity.
            </p>

            <p class="title hidden">Task</p>
            <p class="hidden">
              Analysis of the actual state of Blackshield Capital as a separate
              and independent brand, product analysis, research and development
              of hypotheses for improving the corporate identity. Assessment of
              the market situation as a visual brand in a competitive

              based on existing materials. Improving working conditions and

          Creating a corporate identity. Brandbook and design system.
        </p>
        <p class="description hidden">
          After analyzing the old brand book, collecting the main vision from
          people with key roles, and holding several workshops to understand
          what we needed and what we didn't, we created a new brand book and
          guidelines for the company. After that we continued to move forward
          and created a design system for the company that had never existed
          before.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitle hidden">Website re-design.</p>
        <p class="description hidden">
          To re-design the website, we identified the strengths of the website
          and problematic areas that needed to be improved. We prepared the
          content. Thanks to the help of our PM and an outsourced specialist (ux
          writer), we created high-quality text and visual support that answers
          all customer questions and presents information about the company in
          an accessible way.

        <p class="subtitle hidden">
          Updating social media & additional channels of communication.
        </p>
        <p class="description hidden">
          The emergence of an SMM specialist and new guidelines helped us
          develop a system of templates for this area. Subscriptions and new
          content formats, quarterly reports, weekly, lead generation improved.
          News columns and insights from the company.
